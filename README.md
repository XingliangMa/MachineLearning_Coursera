These scripts are intended for me to learn Python by following Andrew Ng's Machine Learning classes on Coursera. The course requires Octave/Matlab, which demands little programming skills. I used Octave to submit all the homework but here I tried to work out the problems in Python just to see how Python excels (or not) in scientific computing as a general programming language.
